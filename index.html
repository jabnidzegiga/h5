        <h2>about</h2>
        <h5>Ego has no place in the design process. Fail quickly to succeed quickly.
            Negative feedback is a gift. Universal design is ethical design.
            Designers are toolmakers.
            Meet people where they are. Be a facilitator.
            Define the problem. Play. There's always more than one solution.
            Empathy is the key to resonance. You are not your user.</h5>
